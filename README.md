# Last Moon

In the year 2032, global warming has brought down on Earth uncountable catastrophes that looking for a new planet to inhabit is no longer a precaution but a priority for the human race. You are an astronaut with your life-long partner on a mission to explore one of the possibly habitable planets found by scientists. As you arrive after more than 9 months of space travel, you find that the planet is no longer habitable and are forced to make a return trip. Unfortunately, one of the fuel tanks has leaked and you calculate that there is not enough fuel to make it back home safely. Your only bet is to send an SOS signal back to Earth and wait for help to arrive. As you wait, you feel safe that your partner is by your side. Months pass and one day, on a bright moon day, your partner suddenly disappears without a trace. You are left confused and devastated. Will you wait for them without any assurance that they will return? It's been 281 days since and a new moon is rising.

## Technical setup instructions

The game can be accessed through Unity by importing the scene and assets. See [how to download and install Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

## Visual 

The game is made mainly using assets from the unity asset store. [This one](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/modular-sci-fi-corridor-142811) in particular was used extensively because of its space-like vibe.

## Showcase

## Reflection

I did not expect to put together a working space so quickly. The asset I found from the store and from my class fit together nicely since I could apply the space material to almost every prefab. Playing around with lighting was also very fun and challenging, since figuring out how to set the dreadful mood was something I had to experiment with extensively. I also did some work with the Probuilder tool to make the space fit to my liking which was sometime a bit of a hassle because of its effect on the prefabs' meshes.

Looking forward, I want to implement the whole story I had in mind by adding different spaces and clues for the players. I also want to implement the option to walk out into space soon (although I already left two doors in the current room that both lead out of space!).
